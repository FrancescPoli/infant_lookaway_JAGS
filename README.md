# infant_lookaway_JAGS
Bayesian hierarchical model for the detection of individual differences in infants' looking behavior

The model works on the data that is available in Poli et al. (2020): https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/6/39/eabb5053

The model can be extended to work on any dataset in which participants free looking behavior is recorded.
