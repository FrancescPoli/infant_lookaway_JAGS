# infant_lookaway_JAGS
Bayesian hierarchical model for the detection of individual differences in infants' looking behavior

The model works on the data that was collected in Poli et al. (2020): https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/6/39/eabb5053
Data is available in the repository http://hdl.handle.net/11633/aadgbtz7 or can be made available by me upon request.

The model can be extended to work on any dataset in which participants free looking behavior is recorded.
